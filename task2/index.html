          <b>Pamulaparti Venkata Narasimha Rao</b> (28 June 1921 â€“ 23 December 2004) was an Indian politician who served as
          the 9th Prime Minister of India from 1991 to 1996. He was born in a small village in present-day Telangana and
          was a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress. Rao led the country during a critical period when
          economic reforms were initiated to liberalize the Indian economy and end the "License Raj."
        </p>
        <p>
          As Prime Minister, Rao introduced significant economic reforms, including dismantling industrial licensing and
          permitting foreign investment in various sectors. His government initiated the process of liberalization,
          privatization, and globalization that transformed India's economy. These reforms, often referred to as the Rao
          reforms, paved the way for India's economic growth in subsequent decades. Rao's leadership and policies are
          credited with pulling India out of an economic crisis and putting it on the path of economic development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rao also played a crucial role in India's foreign policy. He was instrumental in normalizing relations with
          several countries, including the United States and China. He oversaw the resolution of the longstanding Kashmir
          conflict by signing the Lahore Declaration with Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
        </p>
        <p>
          P.V. Narasimha Rao was a visionary leader who played a significant role in shaping modern India. His legacy
          continues to be remembered and appreciated for his contributions to the nation's progress.
